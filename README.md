## About
This skill is designed to work with [OurGroceries](https://www.ourgroceries.com) app. This is an *UNOFFICIAL* skill which I developed as a convenience for interacting with the app. The application developers are not responsible for this skill. Please do not direct any problems with the Mycroft skill anywhere but the issues section.

With this skill you can:
* add new shopping lists
* add new categories
* add items to a specific list
* add items to a specific list under a category
* add multiple items to a specific list
* add multiple items to a specific list under a category

*NOTE* adding multiple items is still bound by the default Mycroft timeout, so you are still limited to 10 seconds or less

## Examples

### Add Categories
* "add the category {Category} to (my | the) (list | shopping list | grocery list)"
* "create the category {Category} in (my |the ) (list | shopping list | grocery list)"

### Add Items
* "add {Food} to (| (the | my)) {ShoppingList} (| list) (under {Category} |)"
* "(please |) add multiple items to (| (the | my)) {ShoppingList} (under {Category} |)"
* "I want to add multiple items to (| (the | my)) {ShoppingList} (under {Category} |)"

### Create new lists
* "start a new list called {ListName}"
* "create a new list called {ListName}"
* "create a list called {ListName}"
* "start a list called {ListName}"
